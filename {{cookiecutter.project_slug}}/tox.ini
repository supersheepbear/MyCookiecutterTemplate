# Detailed explanation for beginners:

# 1. [tox] section:
#    - envlist: Specifies which test environments to run. In this case, it will run tests
#      on Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and also run the flake8 code style checker.

# 2. [travis] section:
#    - This section is used by Travis CI, a service that automatically runs your tests
#      when you push code to your repository.
#    - It maps Python versions to tox environments. For example, when Travis uses
#      Python 3.8, it will run the 'py38' tox environment.

# 3. [testenv:flake8] section:
#    - This creates a special environment for running flake8, a tool that checks
#      your code style and quality.
#    - It installs flake8 and runs it on the '{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}' and 'tests' directories.

# 4. [testenv] section:
#    - This section defines settings for all test environments (py36, py37, py38).
#    - setenv: Sets the PYTHONPATH environment variable to the directory containing tox.ini.
#    - deps: Installs dependencies from the requirements_dev.txt file.
#    - commands: 
#      - Upgrades pip to the latest version.
#      - Runs pytest (a testing framework) using a temporary directory for test files.

# The commented-out line about requirements.txt is a reminder that you can use a
# separate requirements file with pinned versions if you want to ensure all
# environments use the exact same package versions.
